PROJECT TITLE:BTSDictionary
VERSION or DATE: Apr 07, 2020
AUTHORS: Mo'men Mushtaha
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
implement a way to manage a Table/Dictionary, with operations on that ADT specified in the
interface Dictionary.java. The Table stores Strings, referenced by SortableStrings (Strings that implement the
Sortable interface). Your implementation should internally use a Binary Search Tree (BST). The trees in turn are
to be implemented using references.
